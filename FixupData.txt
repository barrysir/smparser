gets a listing of all files in directory
filters them into several vectors, music, image, movie, lyrics

if the sm file audio is undefined (incorrect file path), then audio is set to the first file in the music vector

the length of the music file is calculated m_fMusicLengthSeconds
the length of the preview is calculated (there's a preview path?!)
	in SSC files you can specify a separate audio file to be the preview

lyrics file is set if undefined and there exists a lyrics file
banner, background, jacket, cdtitle are set in the same way, based on some naming keywords
if they're still not found, then every image in the directory is opened and the sizes are matched up to guess if one is a banner, jacket, etc.

if there is a movie, then automatically add a background change saying to play it at offset t=0 seconds
	this shouldn't be included in the parser

this is not file parsing, so it shouldn't be automatically done by the parser
